### Liketechnik's Tinker Tweaks

This mod basically gives you back the behaviour of the old [Iguana Tinker Tweaks](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/IguanaTweaksTConstruct) for MC 1.7.10 (and downwards). It is based on [Tinker's Tool Leveling](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling), but has a completely different behaviour: For every new level, you get a random modifier applied to your tool. If you want to go fully crazy, you can configure the mod to give you a free modifier every level on top of that.

# **Note**

**This is currently WIP, don't use it as long as the transition isn't completely finished.**
