# Liketechnik's Tinker Tweaks

This mod basically gives you back the behaviour of the old [Iguana Tinker Tweaks](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/IguanaTweaksTConstruct) for MC 1.7.10 (and downwards). It is based on [Tinker's Tool Leveling](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling), but has a completely different behaviour: For every new level, you get a random modifier applied to your tool. If you want to go fully crazy, you can configure the mod to give you a free modifier every level on top of that.

# Download

This mod is currently only available for MC 1.12. You can find the latest release on GitHub: https://github.com/liketechnik/Liketechnik-s-Tinker-Tweaks/releases

To use this mod you obviously need Tinker's Construct.

# Credits

This mod forked from  [Tinker's Tool Leveling](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling), that provided the base for this mod. I'm really thankfull for their mod (you can find the reason for the fork here: https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersToolLeveling/issues/8), if you just want the free modifiers, go there.

The idea comes from  [Iguana Tinker Tweaks](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/IguanaTweaksTConstruct), that added the bahaviour in MC 1.7.10.
